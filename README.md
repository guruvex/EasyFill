# EasyFill
I built this auto copy web app to make copy and paste easy when filling out a lot of the same forms.
to make this work for you search for the word put and fill in your information there
don't overwrite the single or double quotes this will brake it
the lines with title will give a hint when the mouse hovers over it. this is useful for making sure of the info your copying
such as two email addresses with the same name but different email services like gmail and yahoo.

WARNING: this is personal information please treat this like you would your bank info or SSN.
keep this in a secure place such as an encrypted file, folder or drive.
also if there is a chance someone could walk by your computer and read it, do not put your info on the button names.
if you do anyone walking by can steal this info.

i do not take responsibility for what you do with this file or the information you choose to put it in.
